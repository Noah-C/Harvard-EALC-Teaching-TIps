Great, I’ll create a detailed UI/UX frontend design requirements markdown file for the one-page HEAC booklet app.
It will include:

* A full-screen Harvard-style welcome section with CTA
* A consistent professor layout
* Smooth scroll-triggered animations (auto-triggered)
* Persistent top-left Harvard logo

I’ll structure it so your frontend engineer can implement it with full clarity, referencing layout, style tokens, animation timing, and markup structure.


# Harvard East Asian Center “Teaching Tips” – UI/UX Frontend Design Requirements

## Overview

This document outlines the UI/UX frontend design requirements for the **Harvard East Asian Center “Teaching Tips”** digital booklet. The booklet is a single-page scrollable booklet React web application that showcases teaching tips from faculty in a visually engaging, Harvard-branded format. The page is composed of a fullscreen welcome hero and a series of professor highlight sections that appear as the user scrolls. Key design features include a strong Harvard identity (colors, typography, logo), smooth scroll-triggered animations, and a responsive layout. The goal is to provide a clean, immersive experience that feels modern yet aligned with Harvard’s design language, and is actionable for frontend implementation.

## Fullscreen Hero Section (Welcome)

&#x20;*Example of a Harvard-style hero section with large overlaid text.* The top of the page features a fullscreen **hero section** that introduces the digital booklet and invites users to begin. This hero is styled similarly to Harvard’s main site heroes: it uses a compelling full-width background image with a dark overlay and bold typography to capture attention. The hero should immediately convey the theme (teaching tips / East Asian studies) and set the tone for the rest of the page. It includes a prominent heading, a short subtitle, and a subtle call-to-action prompting the user to scroll. The overall aesthetic is aspirational and professional, using Harvard’s serif and sans-serif fonts in a dramatic, high-contrast presentation.

* **Background & Overlay:** The hero occupies the full viewport height (`height: 100vh`) for an immersive first impression. Use a high-quality background image (or looping video) relevant to East Asian teaching or Harvard (for example, a classroom scene, students and faculty in an East Asian context, or a Harvard campus image). Apply a semi-transparent **dark overlay** (e.g., a black layer at \~50% opacity) on top of the image to ensure the white text overlay is legible against it. This mimics the Harvard.edu style where background imagery is visible but subdued by an overlay for contrast. The background image should utilize a CSS cover strategy (centered cropping via `background-size: cover; background-position: center;`) so it fills the screen and remains visually appealing at different aspect ratios.

* **Hero Heading (Title):** A large **serif** heading in *Playfair Display* font dominates the hero. This text serves as the welcome message or tagline. It should be set in a large size for impact – roughly **3.5rem** (≈56px) on desktop screens, scaling down to \~**2rem** (32px) on small screens. Use a bold or semi-bold weight for emphasis if available (or regular weight if the font’s high contrast is striking enough at large size). The heading is in **white** (#FFFFFF) to stand out on the dark overlay. For alignment, center the heading text within the hero both horizontally and vertically (on mobile, also center-align the text; on desktop, it can be centered or slightly left-aligned depending on the composition of the background image). Ensure there is ample side padding (e.g., \~2rem) so that the text doesn’t touch the edges of the viewport. If the heading runs onto two lines, use a tight line-height (\~1.1) so the lines stay visually grouped.

* **Hero Subheading (Tagline):** Directly below the main heading, include a short **subtext tagline** in *Inter* (sans-serif). This should be a one- or two-sentence introduction or explanation, setting context for what the user is about to see (e.g., “Insights from Harvard faculty on engaging East Asian studies in the classroom”). The subheading font size should be significantly smaller than the main title – around **1.25rem** (\~20px) on desktop, down to **1rem** (16px) on mobile – and use a regular weight. It should also be colored white or a light gray for readability (for example, `color: #FFFFFFCC;` – white at 80% opacity – to distinguish it slightly from the pure white heading). Maintain a modest gap above it (e.g., 0.5rem–1rem below the heading) to clearly separate it from the title. Keep the subheading text to a concise length and roughly the same width as the heading for a neat look (no extremely long lines – aim for \~60% of the hero width max).

* **Call to Action – “Scroll to Begin”:** At the bottom of the hero section, provide a subtle visual cue to encourage users to start scrolling. This can be a downwards arrow icon, the text “Scroll to begin,” or a combination of both. For example, a common design is a downward chevron **⌄** or arrow inside a circle, with the words “Scroll to begin” beside or below it. Style this CTA in *Inter* as well, in all caps or small caps for clarity (e.g., “SCROLL TO BEGIN”), at about **1rem** (16px) font size. The CTA element should be **centered horizontally** and positioned near the bottom of the hero (with a small bottom margin so it’s not flush with the screen edge). You may animate this indicator to draw attention – for instance, a gentle up-and-down motion or a fading in/out – but keep it subtle and in a loop (e.g., a 2 second ease-in-out y-axis translate to mimic a bouncing arrow). The CTA (arrow or text) should be clickable/tappable: on click, it should smoothly scroll the user to the next section (use a scroll behavior with the same easing as other animations). Use Harvard Crimson or white for the arrow icon if it needs to stand out; for example, a white arrow icon inside a small Harvard Crimson circular button could be effective, as seen on some Harvard sites. The overall effect should clearly signal interactivity without introducing a full traditional “button.”

* **Sample Welcome Messages:** Below are two sample hero welcome messages (heading + subtext) that capture the tone and content we want. These are examples to guide content and style – the actual text can be refined by content writers.

  1. **Heading:** *“Teaching East Asia, Inspiring Excellence”* – **Subtext:** *“Harvard faculty share their most effective classroom strategies and insights for East Asian studies.”*
  2. **Heading:** *“Innovative Teaching, Timeless Traditions”* – **Subtext:** *“Explore how Harvard’s East Asia educators blend tradition with innovation through practical teaching tips.”*

  Each version uses an active, inspirational tone. The first emphasizes excellence and direct sharing of tips, while the second highlights the theme of balancing innovation with tradition in East Asian education. The heading should remain short and impactful, and the subtext should invite the reader to learn more, setting up the scroll.

## Professor Sections (Teaching Tips Content)

&#x20;*Example of a content section with image on the left and text on the right, using Harvard’s brand style (dark background, white serif heading). In this Harvard site example, an image and the heading “Regained mobility for stroke survivors” illustrate a similar layout.* As the user scrolls past the hero, they encounter each professor’s **Teaching Tip** in its own section. These professor sections appear one by one, each following a **consistent layout** and style to unify the booklet. The design is kept intentionally uniform: every section pairs a photograph of the professor (or an image representing their tip) on the left with the professor’s name, title, and teaching tip text on the right (on desktop screens). The background is a solid Harvard dark color, and all text is in white, creating a high-contrast “card” for each tip. A subtle separator (such as a decorative ❖ symbol or thin line) divides each section. The appearance of these sections is enhanced with smooth scroll-triggered animations so content gracefully fades or slides into view as the user progresses. The overall effect should be that of a modern digital booklet or slideshow that the user scrolls through, with each Teaching Tip presented as a distinct but related panel.

* **Desktop Layout (Two-Column):** Each professor section is arranged in two columns. The **portrait image** is on the **left half** of the section, and the textual content (professor’s name, title, and tip) is on the **right half**. Use a flexible approach like CSS Grid or Flexbox to achieve this split. The image should take roughly 50% of the viewport width, and the text container 50%, on large screens. Vertically, the section should have ample padding so that it doesn’t feel cramped (e.g., at least **4rem** padding top and bottom on desktop). Ideally, the content in the text column is vertically centered within the section for a balanced look — for example, if a professor’s tip is short, you might center that text block relative to the image height. However, avoid relying on absolute centering if it complicates responsiveness; simply ensure there is generous top/bottom padding to create visual centering. If using a max-width container (see Layout & Spacing below), center that container so the design remains symmetric. Importantly, maintain a **gutter** between the two columns – e.g., add \~2rem of padding on the right side of the image or left side of the text column – so that the text doesn’t directly touch the image. This will ensure readability and a clean separation between image and text. The overall section width can span the full browser window for a dramatic, full-bleed look (image touching the left edge, text touching the right edge), but ensure the content within the text column doesn’t stretch too wide for comfort (limiting paragraph width improves readability).

* **Mobile & Tablet Layout (Stacked):** The design is fully **responsive**. On smaller screens (approximately below **768px width** or a suitable breakpoint), switch to a **stacked layout** for each section. In the stacked layout, the image should appear **above** the text content. The image can take the full width of the screen (edge-to-edge) and be followed by the text block filling the width. Provide sufficient spacing between the image and the text block (e.g., 1.5rem margin-top) so they don’t collide. Also, apply horizontal padding to the text on mobile (e.g., 1rem side padding) so that the text isn’t flush with the screen edges. On mobile, you may also choose to center-align the text content for a neater appearance, or keep it left-aligned — either can work, but left alignment is often fine for readability. The **persistent Harvard logo** (top-left) will scale down appropriately on mobile (see Branding & Logo section) to not overlap content. On **tablet** sizes or medium screens, you can either use the two-column layout if there’s enough space or a hybrid: e.g., two-column in landscape tablet, stacked in portrait tablet. Ensure breakpoints are tested so that the image and text don’t become too squished side by side on narrower tablets; it’s preferable to switch to stacked a bit earlier if needed to maintain visual clarity. The transitions between layouts should be smooth, and all content that exists on desktop (images, text) remains present on mobile (no content hiding, only reflowing).

* **Professor Portrait Image Styling:** Each professor’s photo (or illustrative image) on the left should be displayed at a large size to give visual weight to the section. The image container covers the full column and auto-adjusts height based on content or viewport. Use `object-fit: cover` on `<img>` or background-image to ensure the image covers the container and is cropped appropriately, without distortion. Maintain consistent **aspect ratio** or cropping for all portraits for a uniform look (for instance, if using portrait orientation photos, ensure all are, say, 3:4 ratio and align faces similarly within the frame). There’s no need for fancy borders or shadows on the images – keep them clean-edged to look modern. However, if any image is very light and has a lot of white, you might consider a **very subtle overlay** gradient on the image’s right side (where text might be adjacent) to ensure the white text nearby remains legible. In most cases, this won’t be necessary since the text is on a separate solid background area, but it’s something to keep in mind for extreme cases. The images should load in an optimized format (JPG or WebP for photos) and be responsive (using `srcset` or CSS `background-image` techniques) to look crisp on both high-DPI and standard screens.

* **Text Content Block (Name, Title, Tip):** On the right side of each section (below the image on mobile), present the professor’s details and their teaching tip. All text is set on a **solid dark background** (blending with the overall page background) to ensure consistency. Use a structured hierarchy for this content:

  * **Professor Name:** This should be prominently displayed at the top of the text block, as an entry point to the section. Use the *Playfair Display* font for the name to echo the hero’s serif heading style. The name can be styled as a second-level heading (e.g., `<h2>` for semantics, since the hero might be an `<h1>`). Size should be around **1.5rem** (24px) on desktop, slightly smaller on mobile if needed (e.g., 1.25rem). The name is in **white** text for maximum contrast. Consider using a semi-bold weight for the name if available, to help it stand out, since it’s the section “title.” If the name is very long or includes credentials, it’s acceptable to break it into two lines or use a slightly smaller size to fit, but aim for it to be on one line on desktop if possible. Add a bit of margin (e.g., 0.2–0.5rem) below the name to separate it from the title that follows.
  * **Professor Title/Position:** On the line immediately after the name (or on the same line separated by a comma, if brevity permits), list the professor’s title or position (for example, *“Professor of East Asian Languages and Civilizations”*). This provides context and should be visually subordinate to the name. Use the *Inter* font for the title to differentiate it from the name (creating a nice serif/sans contrast). The font size should be smaller, around **1rem** (16px) on desktop. You may style it in normal weight or slightly lighter (Inter 400 is fine). To further distinguish the title, you can apply a **slight opacity or color difference** – for instance, using a soft gray-white like `#CCCCCC` instead of pure white, or even italicizing the title text (Inter has an italic style) to set it off from the name. Ensure the contrast is still sufficient against the background (if using light gray, it should be bright enough to read; test for WCAG AA contrast on #1E1E1E). If the title spans multiple lines, use a standard line-height (\~1.3) and keep it below the name. There should be a clear separation (maybe 0.5rem space) before the next element (the tip text).
  * **Teaching Tip Text:** This is the core content – the professor’s teaching tip. It can be one or two sentences or a short paragraph, likely a quote or advice statement. Use *Inter* for this body text for optimal legibility. The font size should be comfortable for reading: \~**1.125rem** (18px) on desktop, and around 1rem (16px) on mobile (you can adjust via responsive CSS). Line-height should be around **1.5** for a multi-line tip to avoid a cramped look. The text is in white. If the content is a direct quote or a particularly important statement, you might stylistically choose to italicize it or put quotation marks – this is optional and can be decided based on how the text looks. (For example, if each tip is essentially a quote from the professor, using an italic style or quote marks could be appropriate; otherwise, just keep it as normal text if it’s more explanatory.) Keep the width of this text block reasonably contained for readability; if your design is full-bleed, consider setting a max-width (around 600px) for the text itself so that on very large screens the line length doesn’t become too wide. There should be some margin after the tip text as well (especially before the separator or next section) – roughly 2rem on desktop – so that the section ends with some breathing room. If there are multiple paragraphs in a tip (unlikely for brevity, but possible), separate them with a small gap (maybe 1rem) and do not indent lines.

* **Background & Colors:** Each professor section uses a **dark theme** to align with Harvard’s design and to make the white text and images pop. The background of the text column (and effectively the whole section) should be a solid **black or near-black** color. Harvard’s palette uses an “Ink” black (a very dark gray) – for example, a color like `#1E1E1E` is often used as Harvard’s black ink tone. Using pure black `#000000` is also acceptable for web if it looks better with the images; the difference is minimal on screens. The key is that it’s a uniform dark background across all sections (the hero and professor sections alike) to create a continuous, immersive experience (no bright white sections to jarringly break the mood). All primary text (names, tips) is in **white** for high contrast. If any text or detail needs to be de-emphasized (like the professor’s title or perhaps the separator), you can use a **muted white/gray**. A common approach is to use white at some opacity (e.g., 70-80%) to achieve a gray look without introducing a new color – for instance, `rgba(255,255,255,0.8)` yields a light gray on dark. Harvard’s official secondary palette includes some neutral grays (such as “Mortar” gray or “Slate”), but those skew darker and might not show up well on a black background. It’s simplest to use translucent white or a very light gray like `#aaa` to distinguish secondary text. The **Harvard Crimson** red is reserved as an accent (more on that in Color Palette below) – it can be used sparingly in these sections (for example, as the color of the separator symbol or any small icons) but **do not use Crimson for large text blocks** (red text on dark background would have contrast issues and depart from the elegant style; plus, all sections being uniform in white text is more consistent). The consistent use of white on dark gives the booklet a sleek, modern look that aligns with many Harvard digital publications.

* **Separator Between Sections:** To delineate one professor’s section from the next in the scrolling layout, include a subtle **separator** element. This prevents the content from running together and provides a visual pause. The separator should be in keeping with the Harvard aesthetic – simple and elegant. There are two recommended styles:

  * **Decorative Symbol (“❖”):** A small diamond-shaped symbol (❖) can serve as a classy divider. This could be a literal text character or an icon. Size it modestly (e.g., 0.8rem to 1rem). Center this symbol horizontally in the page. You can give it a color from the Harvard palette for a subtle accent – for instance, Harvard Crimson could be used to fill the diamond, injecting a tiny pop of color between sections. Alternatively, a neutral such as a gray or gold from Harvard’s accents could work, but Crimson is most on-brand. Keep the symbol fairly faint (you might even reduce its opacity) so it doesn’t demand too much attention. Place \~2rem of margin above and below the symbol, so there’s spacing between the end of one section and the start of the next. Example: `❖` in Crimson, centered, with 32px margin top and bottom.
  * **Horizontal Rule:** A thin line can also act as a separator. Use a 1px or 2px high horizontal line, centered within the content column (or full-width if you prefer edge-to-edge). A line length of about 60px (or some proportion of the screen width, like 10%) works well to make it look like a designed element rather than a full divider. Color the line in a very dark gray (e.g., #333333) or a dull Crimson. On a black background, a medium-dark gray line will be barely visible (which might be too subtle), so you could use a lighter gray (e.g., #666) at low opacity. The line should be visually quieter than any text. As with the symbol, give vertical spacing around it. This line approach is more minimal than the diamond; choose based on the Center’s preference.

  Whichever style is chosen, use it consistently between all professor sections. The separator is not meant to distract – its role is purely to signal “end of one tip, start of another” in a gentle way. (Note: Do not use heavy graphical flourishes or bright colors here, as that would clash with the clean design. The diamond or short line is sufficiently ornamental for this scholarly context.)

* **Persistent Harvard Logo (Top-Left):** In lieu of a traditional navbar, the Harvard branding is conveyed through a **persistent Harvard logo** fixed at the top-left of the page. This should remain visible at all times as the user scrolls (i.e., use CSS `position: fixed` or `sticky` positioning at top:0, left:0). The logo should be the official Harvard University logo mark – typically the Harvard **Veritas shield** accompanied by the word “Harvard” (or “Harvard University”) in the official typeface. Since this booklet is under the East Asian Center, it’s possible to use the Harvard University parent logo for broad recognition. The logo needs to be adapted for a dark background: ideally, use a **reversed version** of the logo (Harvard often provides an all-white or white-and-crimson version for dark backgrounds). For example, the shield could remain in full color (crimson shield with white **VERITAS** text) while the wordmark “Harvard University” is set in white. If a single-color variant is available (e.g., all-white shield with a transparent background), that can also be used for simplicity. The logo’s size should be relatively small so as not to dominate the interface: approximately **40px tall** for the shield icon is a good reference on desktop, with the text next to it proportionally sized (the text will likely be \~100px wide or so at that scale). On mobile screens, you may scale the logo down (e.g., 30px tall shield) to save space. Place the logo with a bit of intrinsic padding or margin from the viewport edges – about **1rem from the top and left** – so it isn’t clipped to the corner. There should be no other navigation items or links in the header; the logo itself can optionally link to the Harvard or center homepage if desired, but no menu is present (the experience is meant to be a single-scroll journey). Also, do not put a background box behind the logo; let it float over the content. (The sections behind are dark, so a white logo will show up well. In the hero, which has a dark overlay, it will also be visible. If needed for legibility at any point, a subtle drop-shadow or outline could be added to the logo, but likely unnecessary if using the correct variant.) This persistent logo ensures Harvard branding is always evident, reinforcing credibility, while keeping the interface minimal.

## Layout & Spacing Guidelines

Consistent spacing and alignment are crucial for a polished one-page design. This section details general layout metrics and spacing rules that apply across the hero and professor sections:

* **Overall Page Structure:** The design uses a **single-column flow** of sections (no separate pages or complex navigation). However, you should **constrain the content width** for readability on large screens. For instance, consider using a max-width of around **1200px** for the content within each section (text elements), and center this within the viewport. This means that on extremely wide screens, the text won’t stretch too far; the image on left can either also have a max-width or can bleed to full width for effect. A centered container approach is recommended so that the layout looks balanced on large monitors (with equal empty space on both sides beyond 1200px). The background colors and images can extend full width to fill the screen, but the text content would respect this max width. On smaller screens, this max-width naturally doesn’t apply as the viewport is narrower.

* **Section Height & Padding:** The **hero section** is fixed at 100% viewport height so it always fills the screen initially. For the **professor sections**, there’s no fixed height (content-driven), but aim for a **comfortable vertical padding** so each section feels substantial. As a guideline, use \~**4rem** top and bottom padding on desktop for each section. This ensures that even if a section’s text is short, there is space above and below it (preventing it from looking like it immediately butts against the previous/next content). On mobile, you can reduce this padding to maybe **2rem** top and bottom, since screen space is at a premium – but do maintain some padding so things aren’t cramped. The result should be that as the user scrolls, each new section has a bit of breathing room to be identified as a separate block. Also ensure a **consistent gap between the hero and the first professor section**; e.g., the hero might naturally scroll off and the next section scrolls up, but if needed, you could place the same separator or a bit of extra padding to visually separate the hero from the first tip.

* **Gutters and Margins:** In the two-column layout, implement **gutters** between columns as noted. If using CSS Grid, set `grid-gap: 2rem` (or similar) between the image and text columns. If using Flexbox, you could apply `margin-right` on the image or `margin-left` on the text. Additionally, think about vertical alignment: in each professor section’s grid, you might use `align-items: center` to vertically center the content if the grid container is taller than the content. For text elements within the right column, use consistent margins to separate them (as described: e.g., margin-bottom after name and title). Also, on the outer sides of the layout, ensure content isn’t too close to screen edges. We covered hero text padding; similarly, the text column on desktop can have a small right padding (e.g., 2rem) so the text doesn’t touch the very right edge of the browser window. On mobile, **side margins** of \~1rem should be applied to both the image (if it’s an `<img>` just make it width:100% with no margins, that’s fine) and the text container (padding within a container or margins on the container) to avoid any element touching the viewport edge. Visually, all text and images should sit within a “safety area” from the edges.

* **Responsive Behavior Summary:** The design should be tested at multiple breakpoints to ensure a smooth adaptation. Key breakpoints might be \~768px (where the layout switches to single column) and perhaps \~1024px (where maybe you adjust font sizes slightly or padding). Use CSS media queries or responsive units to scale typography (for example, you might use `clamp()` in CSS to smoothly adjust hero text size from mobile to desktop). Verify that the **hero** text remains readable and well-composed on small screens (if an image is used, maybe center focus on mobile and overlay text on center; you can even consider swapping the background image to a more mobile-friendly one via `srcset` or CSS if needed). Check that the **professor sections** on mobile have the image and text in correct order (image first, then text as intended) – using flex or grid `order` properties or simply source ordering in HTML can control that. Also, ensure the **persistent logo** doesn’t overlap with any content – for instance, on a short mobile screen, the logo at top might cover part of the hero heading if not careful; to avoid this, you could add top padding to the hero equal to the logo’s height, or make the logo container height part of the page flow (using position: sticky in a header that still takes up space). The simplest path: a fixed logo with manual padding in CSS on the hero (like `.hero { padding-top: 3rem; }`) so that the hero text is pushed below it. On desktop, this might not be needed if the hero content is vertically centered and the logo is relatively small, but it’s worth considering to prevent any overlap on all devices.

* **Accessibility & Readability:** All spacing and layout choices should also consider readability and accessibility. Large text and good contrast (which we have) are great for accessibility. Keep an eye on keyboard navigation focus order – the logo at top might be focusable (if it’s a link), then the “Scroll” CTA (if a button), etc. The linear layout means screen readers will read from hero heading through each section in order, which is logical. Just ensure the HTML reflects a logical structure (e.g., use headings for each professor name, which provides structure to assistive tech users). Sufficient spacing not only makes the visual design better but also helps users who might use touch (to not accidentally tap wrong things) and creates distinct regions for those with cognitive considerations.

## Harvard Branding & Style

This project must adhere to Harvard’s branding guidelines in terms of colors, typography, and overall style, creating a consistent Harvard “look and feel.” Below are the specific choices for color palette and fonts, aligned with Harvard identity, and how to apply them in the UI:

* **Color Palette:** The design uses Harvard’s official colors as design tokens. The **primary color** is **Harvard Crimson**, the signature deep red of the university (Hex value **#A51C30**). This should appear in the interface as an accent color – for example, the separator symbol (❖) or interactive highlights (like an arrow icon background) can be in Crimson. It’s a rich color, so use it sparingly on this dark-themed page for maximum effect. The primary **background color** throughout is a Harvard black / dark gray. Harvard’s identity “Ink” black is `#1E1E1E` (a very dark gray which is nearly indistinguishable from black on screens). We can use `#1E1E1E` or simply black `#000000` for the page background and section backgrounds – both are acceptable, but avoid any lighter backgrounds that would break the consistent dark aesthetic. All text is primarily in **white** (`#FFFFFF`) to ensure excellent contrast on the dark background. White is effectively our **primary text color** (Harvard web guidelines treat white as a color too). In a few places, we use a slightly toned-down white or **gray** for secondary text (like professor titles) – for instance, a gray around `#CCCCCC` or `#AAA` can be used, which still meets accessibility contrast on black. If referencing Harvard’s secondary palette, “Parchment” (`#F3F3F1`) is an off-white that could be used for light text on Crimson or other subtle backgrounds, but in our case simple semi-transparent white will suffice for any needed gray. Ensure there’s **consistency**: each section uses the same background color (so the page feels like one continuous story) and the same text colors for similar elements (don’t randomly change a name to Crimson, for example – we want the Crimson to be an accent, not used for section titles or body text). Reserve colored text only for small elements (like maybe the ❖ or an icon). Also, double-check color contrast: white (#FFF) on black (#000) is very high contrast (which is great). White on Crimson would also be high contrast if we ever overlay text on a red element (not planned here, but perhaps if a button was red). Crimson on black is less contrast (but a small symbol like ❖ is okay). If designing any focus states or links, consider using a lighter red or an outline to ensure it’s visible on dark.

* **Typography:** Adhere to the chosen typefaces that align with Harvard’s tone but are also web-friendly. The design will use two fonts: **Playfair Display** and **Inter**. These should be loaded as web fonts (e.g., via Google Fonts or Adobe Fonts).

  * **Playfair Display** is a serif typeface with a classic, elegant feel, suitable for headings and names. Use Playfair for the hero heading and the professor names (and any other major headings). It provides the Harvard “academic” flavor. Make sure to load at least the 400 (regular) and 700 (bold) weights. Playfair is high-contrast, so even its regular weight looks bold at large sizes. Use true bold for extra emphasis if needed (like the hero title). If Playfair is unavailable for some reason, a fallback like Georgia or Times New Roman can be used in the interim, but this is not ideal – the goal is to use the brand-approved or designed fonts.
  * **Inter** is a modern sans-serif known for its clarity on screens. It pairs well with Playfair by offering a neutral, clean look for body text. Use Inter for the hero subheading, professor titles, teaching tip paragraphs, and any UI elements (like the “Scroll” CTA or button text). Load common weights like 400 (normal) and 600 (semi-bold) or 700 (bold). Fallback to system sans-serifs (Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif) if Inter fails to load. Inter ensures small text is legible and has a contemporary feel, preventing the design from looking too stodgy or old-fashioned.
  * **Font Size & Scale:** Establish a clear typographic scale that differentiates elements:

    * Hero Heading: \~**56px** (3.5rem) on large screens, down to \~32px (2rem) on mobile. This should be the largest text on the page by far. It’s okay to adjust using fluid typography for intermediate screen sizes so it’s always proportional.
    * Hero Subheading: \~**20px** (1.25rem) on desktop, \~16px (1rem) on mobile. It should be noticeably smaller than the hero heading but still easy to read at a glance.
    * Professor Name: \~**24px** (1.5rem) on desktop. It acts like a subsection title. On mobile it might be \~20px.
    * Professor Title: \~**16px** (1rem). It’s essentially body text size, or even slightly smaller if needed (but don’t go below \~0.9rem = 14px for readability). If italic, maybe keep at 16px for clarity.
    * Teaching Tip text: **18–20px** (1.125–1.25rem) on desktop, around 16px on mobile. We want the tips to be easily readable as they are the content focus, so we actually make them a bit larger than standard body text when possible (18px is a good comfortable reading size on desktop for paragraphs).
    * CTA “Scroll to begin”: \~**16px**, plus an icon of maybe \~24px size. On mobile, the text might be 14px.
    * Logo text (if any next to shield): likely \~16px as well, since the logo will scale mostly by the shield size. The “Harvard” text in the logo asset might already be set; just ensure it’s legible and not pixelated.
    * These sizes are guidelines – the developer can tweak using responsive techniques. The key is a clear hierarchy: **Hero title > Section titles (names) > Body text (tips) > secondary text (titles/CTA)**.
  * **Font Weight & Style:** Use bold sparingly. The design should generally use **normal weight** for body text (Inter 400) and rely on size and color for hierarchy. The serif Playfair looks distinguished even at normal weight, so bold might only be needed for emphasis or if a part of the text needs highlighting. Avoid using too many different styles; stick to regular and maybe one weight up for headings. Italics can be used for the professor title or tip quotes if it improves the design, but ensure it’s consistently applied (e.g., all titles italic, or all tips italic if they are quotes).
  * **Line Heights & Spacing:** Maintain appropriate line-heights: around **1.4–1.6** for multi-line paragraphs (tips, subheading) to improve readability, and around **1.1–1.2** for headings (hero and names) if they wrap. Also, letter-spacing can be left as default for these fonts (Inter and Playfair have good default metrics; no need for tracked out text, except perhaps in all-caps elements like the CTA, you might set a slight letter-spacing of 1px for a polished look).

* **Interactive States:** Although this is mostly a static-scrolling booklet, if any element is interactive (like the hero scroll arrow or if perhaps the professor images are clickable or something), use subtle Harvard-appropriate styles. For example, if an element on dark is hoverable, on hover you might lighten it or give it a Crimson underline if it were a link. Any focus outlines for accessibility should be clearly visible (you might use a Crimson or white outline focus ring). These details ensure the site feels refined. (This point can be expanded if needed in development, but noting it keeps the design consistent with good UX practices.)

By following the above color and typography guidelines, the page will strongly reflect Harvard’s brand: the Crimson accents, the dignified Playfair font for headlines, and the clean Inter font for content all contribute to that recognizable Harvard style while serving the content needs of this East Asian Teaching Tips booklet.

## Scroll Animations & Effects

One of the highlights of this design is the use of smooth scroll-triggered animations to make content reveal in an engaging way as the user navigates down the page. We will use **Framer Motion** (a React animation library) to implement these interactions, taking advantage of its ease of use for scroll-based animations and spring animations. All animations should be subtle and polished – the goal is to enhance the user experience without distracting from the content. Below are the requirements and recommendations for these animations:

* **Section Appear Animations:** Each professor section should **animate into view** as it enters the viewport. Utilize Framer Motion’s viewport detection (e.g., `<motion.div whileInView={{ ... }} initial={{ ... }} />`) so that when a section scrolls into \~30-50% of the viewport, the animation triggers. The animation style for the sections should combine a **fade-in** with a slight **translate** movement. For example, the section can start at 0.8 opacity and 20px lower than its final position, and animate to full opacity and y=0. A typical Framer Motion configuration might be:

  ```jsx
  <motion.div 
    initial={{ opacity: 0, y: 20 }} 
    whileInView={{ opacity: 1, y: 0 }} 
    transition={{ duration: 0.8, ease: [0.4, 0.0, 0.2, 1] }} 
    viewport={{ once: true, amount: 0.3 }} 
  >
    ...section content...
  </motion.div>
  ```

  Here we set a duration around **0.8s** and use a **cubic-bezier(0.4, 0.0, 0.2, 1)** easing curve (which is a smooth ease-in-out) for the transition. The `viewport.once: true` ensures the animation happens only the first time the section comes into view (no repeat on scroll up/down), and `amount: 0.3` means the trigger happens when 30% of the section is visible. This results in a gentle upward fade that makes content organically appear as the user scrolls.

* **Staggered Elements:** To add a bit more dynamism, you can animate the **image and text separately** with a slight delay between them. For instance, the left image could fade/slide in first, and 100ms or 200ms later the right text fades/slides in. In Framer Motion, this can be done by making the image and text their own motion elements and using a staggerChildren effect on a parent, or simply setting individual delays. A possible effect: image comes from left (initial `{ x: -30, opacity: 0 }` to `{ x: 0, opacity: 1 }`), while text comes from right (initial `{ x: 30, opacity: 0 }` to `{ x: 0, opacity: 1 }`). Both use the same duration (\~0.8s) and easing curve, but the text has `transition.delay: 0.2`. The result will be that as the section scrolls into view, the photo and content smoothly glide towards each other. This reinforces the two-column relationship in a visually pleasing way. However, **keep the stagger subtle** – we don’t want a long gap where the image appears and the text lags too far behind. Around 0.1 to 0.3 seconds delay is plenty. If implementing stagger, ensure it also only triggers once for each section.

* **Hero Entrance:** The hero section is the first thing visible, so it can load with a slight animation as well (though it’s immediately in view on page load). Consider a simple fade-in for the hero text elements when the page loads. For example, the hero heading can fade/slide from below slightly after a short delay (maybe 0.5s after page load), followed by the subheading 0.2s later, then the arrow indicator. These can use the same easing (cubic-bezier as above) but possibly a shorter duration (0.5–0.6s) so that the page doesn’t feel sluggish. This is an optional enhancement; even without it, the hero will look fine, but it adds a nice touch of sophistication if the text gracefully appears over the background image. Use Framer Motion or CSS animations for this as needed (Framer Motion’s `initial` and `animate` on component mount works well).

* **Easing and Motion Feel:** Use the specified **cubic-bezier easing** for all major animations to keep them consistent. The recommended curve (0.4, 0.0, 0.2, 1) is an ease-in-out that mimics a smooth acceleration then deceleration, which feels natural. (This curve is similar to standard Material Design easing, giving a modern feel.) You might also experiment with slightly different curves (e.g., `easeOutQuad` or others), but ensure it’s not too snappy or too linear. Avoid elastic or overshoot animations in this context – those would feel too playful for a Harvard site. The animations should be **purposeful and refined**.

* **Animation Duration:** Aim for animation durations in the range of **600ms to 1000ms (0.6s–1s)**. For example, fading in a section at 0.8s as mentioned is a good median. If you animate the image and text separately, each can be 0.7s, overlapping in time due to the stagger. The hero elements might be a bit quicker to get to content. Consistency matters: don’t make some sections animate very slowly and others quickly; use the same timing function and similar durations for each section’s entrance for uniformity.

* **Scroll Performance:** Implement these animations efficiently to keep scrolling smooth. Framer Motion is generally performant, but avoid animating extremely large images or doing heavy transformations that could jank. Animating opacity and transforms (x, y) as suggested is GPU-accelerated and should be fine. Also, because we use `once: true`, after a section animates in, it’s just static – which is good for performance. Test on a mid-range device to ensure the scroll doesn’t stutter. If performance issues arise, consider simplifying animations (e.g., just fade with no movement).

* **User Control:** The animations trigger on scroll, which is user-controlled, so make sure they feel responsive. If a user scrolls very quickly, the animations should still trigger (they might just happen quickly as multiple sections enter view). That’s okay – each section will animate when it can. The `once: true` prevents re-triggering which could otherwise be annoying. Also, ensure if a user scrolls slowly, they don’t have to wait for an animation to finish before proceeding; the content should become readable quickly as it animates in (hence using an ease that front-loads a bit of the motion, or not delaying content appearance too long).

* **CTA Scroll Behavior:** The hero’s “Scroll to begin” CTA, when clicked, should scroll to the next section **smoothly**. Use the browser’s smooth scroll API or a small script. For consistency, you might even tie it into Framer Motion or GSAP, but a native approach could be:

  ```js
  document.querySelector('#first-section').scrollIntoView({ behavior: 'smooth' });
  ```

  This will animate the scroll. The timing here can depend on browser, but typically it’s around 0.5s to 1s. If more control is needed, a Framer Motion `animate` on scroll position or a GSAP scrollTo could allow the same cubic-bezier easing. The user should feel a gentle transition – not a sudden jump – when they use the CTA. If the user simply scrolls with the mouse or trackpad, the sections will appear as described above.

* **Testing Animations:** Once implemented, test the sequence: scroll into each new section and ensure the animation plays nicely. Test edge cases like resizing the browser (make sure animations still trigger appropriately if layout changes) and refreshing the page mid-scroll (sections currently in view might need an `inView` check to appear without delay). Framer Motion handles a lot of this nicely, but it’s worth double-checking.

By carefully choreographing these animations and interactions, the final experience will feel lively and engaging. Users will be subtly guided down the page, with each teaching tip catching their eye as it animates in. The combination of smooth scroll, elegant easing, and responsive timing will contribute to a professional, polished Harvard presentation of the “Teaching Tips” content.

---

Following this specification will allow a frontend developer to build the Harvard East Asian Center “Teaching Tips” digital booklet with confidence. The design balances Harvard’s classic identity (through color and type) with modern web techniques (responsive layout, scroll animations) to produce a user experience that is both informative and visually compelling. All values and guidelines provided here (font sizes, color codes, spacing measurements, etc.) should be treated as starting points to implement and then fine-tune in the browser for the best result. The end product should look like a seamless extension of Harvard’s web presence, while meeting the specific needs of highlighting teaching tips in a one-page interactive format.
